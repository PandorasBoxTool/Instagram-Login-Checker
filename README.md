# Instagram-Login-Checker
With my tool you have the possibility to see super fast which Instagram accounts of yours are working   
The Instagram accounts must be in a CSV file 
At the end you will get a TXT file where it says which account works and if it does not work where the problem is 
It uses Instagram App Request

As a tip, use a proxy server
